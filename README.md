# ZentTools Too
## A modified ZentTools for the UO Talapas computing cluster
ZentTools Too is an offshoot of ZentTools from the Zentner Lab that I have modified slightly to function properly within the UO computing cluster and with the file types I have accessible from previous work in the lab.
Things are currently being optimized for ChIP-seq analysis, but MNase-, ChEC-, and RNA-seq will be made completely functional later.

All base content is from rpolicastro and zentnerlab, which can be found here: https://github.com/rpolicastro/ZentTools
